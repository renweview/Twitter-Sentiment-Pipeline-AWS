# Twitter-Sentiment-Pipeline-AWS
The goal of this project is to set up an efficient pipeline to analyze tweets for sentiment using AWS EC2, Docker, Apache Spark, Apache Nifi, Apache Kafka, Jupyter Lab, MongoDB, Plotly, Bokeh and Dash. We'll create the skeleton to use this for other data analyses.

To-DO: 
- upload Demo here.
- write out pipeline, include a gantt chart for structuring why we used the frameworks.
